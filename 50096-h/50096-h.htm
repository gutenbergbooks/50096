<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1905, the Syndics of the University Press
asked me to complete, upon the lines laid down
in the preface to volume I, the editing of the reprint
of the Second Folio of the works of Beaumont and
Fletcher which had been begun by Arnold Glover.
The present volume sees the end of the task. In
1906, it was announced that a volume or, possibly,
two volumes of notes would follow the text. These,
together with a critical text of the scattered poems,
must be left to other hands. I hoped, at one time,
to undertake this additional burden myself, but that
seems now to have become impossible.</p>

<span class="i0">And what may bend your honor! how these courses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of loose and lazie pleasures; not suspected<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But done and known, your mind that grants no limit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all your Actions follows, which loose people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That see but through a mist of circumstance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare term ambitious; all your wayes hide sores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opening in the end to nothing but ulcers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your instruments like these may call the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a fearfull clamor, to examine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, and to what we govern. From example<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not for vertues sake ye may be honest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There have been great ones, good ones, and 'tis necessary<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because you are your self, and by your self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A self-peece from the touch of power and Justice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You should command your self, you may imagine<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sins we doe, people behold through opticks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shews them ten times more than common vices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often multiplys them: Then what justice<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Neither to give belief to, nor allowance,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or all the world dare lay upon my worth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As you from dutie, get you better servants<br /></span>
<span class="i0">People of honest actions without ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whip these knaves away, they eat your favours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn 'em unto poysons: my known credit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom all the Courts o' this side <i>Nile</i> have envied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happy she could site me, brought in question<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in my hours of age and reverence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rather superstition should be rendred<br /></span>

<p><i>Devi.</i> <span class="fauxcap">N</span><span class="smcap">o</span> War, no Money, no Master; banish'd the
Court, not trusted in the City, whipt out of
the Countrey, in what a triangle runs our misery: let me hear
which of you has the best voice to beg in, for other hopes or
fortunes I see you have not; be not nice, nature provided you
with tones for the purpose, the peoples charity was your heritage,
and I would see which of you deserves his birth-right.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> We understand you not Captain.</p>

<p><i>Devit.</i> You see this cardicue, the last, and the only
quintessence of 50 Crowns, distill'd in the limbeck of your
gardage, of which happy piece thou shalt be treasurer: now he
that can soonest perswade him to part with't, enjoyes it, possesses
it, and with it, me and my future countenance.</p>

<p><i>1.</i> If they want Art to perswade it, I'll keep it my self.</p>

<p><i>Devit.</i> So you be not a partial judge in your own cause, you shall.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> A match.</p>

<p><i>2.</i> I'll begin to you, brave Sir; be proud to make him
happy by your liberality, whose tongue vouchsafes now to
petition, was never heard before less than to command. I am
a Soldier by profession, a Gentleman by birth, and an Officer
by place, whose poverty blushes to be the cause, that so high
a virtue should descend to the pity of your charity.</p>

<p><i>1.</i> In any case keep your high stile, it is not charity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
shame any man, much less a virtue of your eminence, wherefore
preserve your worth, and I'll preserve my money.</p>

<p><i>3.</i> You perswade? you are shallow, give way to merit:
ah by the bread of [God] man, thou hast a bonny countenance
and a blith, promising mickle good to a sicker womb, that has
trode a long and a sore ground to meet with friends, that will
owe much to thy reverence, when they shall hear of thy
courtesie to their wandring countreyman.</p>

<p><i>1.</i> You that will use your friends so hardly to bring them
in debt, Sir, will deserve worse of a stranger, wherefore pead
on, pead on, I say.</p>

<p><i>4.</i> It is the Welch must do't, I see, comrade man of
urship, <i>St. Tavy</i> be her Patron, the gods of the mountains keep
her cow and her cupboard; may she never want the green of
the Leek, [nor] the fat of the Onion, if she part with her bounties
to him, that is a great deal away from her cozines, and has two
big suits in law to recover her heritage.</p>

<p><i>1.</i> Pardon me Sir, I will have nothing to do with your
suits, it comes within the statute of maintenance: home to
your cozines, and so[w]e garlick and hempseed, the one will stop
your hunger; the other end your suits, <i>gammawash comrade,
gammawash</i>.</p>

<p><i>4.</i> 'Foot he'll hoord all for himself.</p>

<p><i>Vitry.</i> Yes, let him; now comes my turn, I'll see if he
can answer me: save you Sir, they say, you have that I want,
Money.</p>

<p><i>1.</i> And that you are like to want, for ought I perceive yet.</p>

<p><i>Vitry.</i> Stand, deliver.</p>

<p><i>1.</i> 'Foot what mean you, you will not rob the Exchequer?</p>

<p><i>Vitry.</i> Do you prate?</p>

<p><i>1.</i> Hold, hold, here Captain.</p>

<p><i>2.</i> Why I could have done this before you.</p>

<p><i>3.</i> And I.</p>

<p><i>4.</i> And I.</p>

<p><i>Vit.</i> You have done this, brave man be proud to make
him happy, by the bread of God man, thou hast a bonny
countenance, comrade man of urship, <i>St. Tavy</i> be her patron,
out upon you, you uncurried colts, walking cans that have no
souls in you, but a little Rosin to keep your ribs sweet, and
hold in liquor.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Why, what would you have us to do Captain?</p>

<p><i>Devit.</i> Beg, beg, and keep Constables waking, wear out
stocks and whipcord, maunder for butter-milk, dye of the
Jaundice, yet have the cure about you, Lice, large Lice, begot
of your own dust, and the heat of the Brick-kills, may you
starve, and fear of the gallows, which is a gentle consumption
to't, only preferr it, or may you fall upon your fear, and be
hanged for selling those purses to keep you from famine, whose
monies my valour empties, and be cast without other evidence;
here is my Fort, my Castle of defence, who comes by shall pay
me toll, the first purse is your mitimus slaves.</p>

<p><i>2.</i> The purse, 'foot we'll share in the money Captain, if
any come within a furlong of our fingers.</p>

<p><i>4.</i> Did you doubt but we could steal as well as your self,
did not I speak Welsh?</p>

<p><i>3.</i> We are thieves from our cradles, and will dye so.</p>

<p><i>Vit.</i> Then you will not beg again.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Yes, as you did, stand, and deliver.</p>

<p><i>2.</i> Hark, here comes handsel, 'tis a Trade quickly set up,
and as soon cast down.</p>

<p><i>Vitry.</i> Have goodness in your minds varlets, and to't like
men; he that has more money than we, cannot be our friend,
and I hope there is no law for spoiling the enemy.</p>

<p><i>3.</i> You need not instruct us farther, your example pleads
enough.</p>

<p><i>Devitry.</i> Disperse your selves, and as their company is,
fall on.</p>

<p><i>2.</i> Come, there are a band of 'em, I'll charge single.      <span class="directline">[<i>Exit Soldier[s].</i></span></p></div>

<p class="drop-capw"><i><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>, Inductions are out of date, and a Prologue in
Verse, is as stale as a black Velvet Cloak, and a Bay
Garland: therefore you shall have it plain Prose, thus: If there
be any amongst you, that come to hear lascivious Scenes, let them
depart: for I do pronounce this, to the utter discomfort of all
twopenny Gallery men, you shall have no bawdery in it: or
if there be any lurking amongst you in corners, with Table-books,
who have some hope to find fit matter to feed his&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; malice on,
let them claspe them up, and slink away, or stay and be converted.
For he that made this Play, means to please Auditors so, as he
may be an Auditor himself hereafter, and not purchase them with
the dear [losse] of his [e]ares: I dare not call it</i> Comedy <i>or</i> Tragedy;
<i>'tis perfectly neither: A Play it is, which was meant to make you
laugh, how it [will] please you, is not written in my Part: for
though you should like it to day, perhaps your selves know not how
you should digest it to morrow: Some things in it you may meet
with, which are out of the common road: a Duke there is, and
the Scæne lies in Italy, as those two things lightly we never miss.
But you shall not find in it the ordinary and over-worn Trade
of jesting at Lords and Courtiers, and Citizens, without taxation
of any particular or new vice by them found out, but at the persons
of them; such, he, that made this, thinks vile, and for his own
part vows; That he did never think, but that a [Lord] born
might be a wise man, and a Courtier an honest man.</i></p></div>

the State; he thinks to discover as much out of the talk of
drunkards in Tap-houses: he brings me informations, pick'd
out of broken words, in mens common talk, which, with his
malicious mis-application, he hopes will seem dangerous, he
doth besides, bring me the names of all the young Gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>

affects to be a great States-man, and thinks it consists in
night-caps and jewells, and tooth-picks.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> And what's that other?</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> A Knight Sir, that pleaseth the Duke to favour,
and to raise to some extraordinary fortunes, he can make as
good men as himself, every day in the week, and doth&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> For what was he raised?</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Truely Sir, I am not able to say directly, for what;
But for wearing of red breeches as I take it; he's a brave
man, he will spend three Knighthoods at a Supper without
Trumpets.</p>

make here with him and his Councell? She hath no papers
in her hand to petition to them, she hath never a husband
in prison, whose release she might sue for: That's a fine
trick for a wench; to get her husband clapt up, that she may
more freely, and with less suspition, visit the private studies
of men in authority. Now I doe discover their consultation,
yon fellow is a Pander without all salvation: But let me
not condemn her too rashly without weighing the matter;
she's a young Lady, she went forth early this morning with
a waiting woman, and a Page, or so: This is no garden
house; in my conscience she went forth with no dishonest
intent: for she did not pretend going to any Sermon in the
further end of the City: Neither went she to see any odd
old Gentlewoman, that mourns for the death of her husband,
or the loss of her friend, and must have young Ladys come
to comfort her: those are the damnable Bawds: 'Twas no
set meeting certainly; for there was no wafer-woman with
her these three days on my knowledge: I'll talk with her;
Good morrow my Lord.</p>

amongst the purest hearted creatures of her sex, and the freest
from dissimulation; for their deeds are all alike, only they dare
speak, what the rest think: the women of this age, if there be
any degrees of comparison amongst their sex, are worse than
those of former times; for I have read of women, of that truth,
spirit, and constancy, that were they now living, I should
endure to see them: but I fear the writers of the time belied
them, for how familiar a thing is it with the Poets of our
age, to extoll their whores, which they call Mistresses, with
heavenly praises! but I thank their furies, and their craz'd
brains, beyond belief: nay, how many that would fain seem
serious, have dedicated grave Works to Ladies, toothless, hollow-ey'd,
their hair shedding, purple fac'd, their nails apparently
coming off; and the bridges of their noses broken down,
and have call'd them the choice handy works of nature, the
patterns of perfection, and the wonderment of Women. Our
Women begin to swarm like Bees [in] Summer: as I came
hither, there was no pair of stairs, no entry, no lobby, but was
pestred with them: methinks there might be some course taken

Women [only] above all other creatures that were created for

<p>Sir, but that I do presume upon your secresie, I would not
have appear'd to you thus ignorantly attir'd without a tooth-pick
in a ribbond, or a Ring in my bandstring[s].</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> Your Lordship sen[t] for me?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I did: Sir, your long practice in the State, under
a great man, hath led you to much experience.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> My Lord.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Suffer not your modesty to excuse it: in short, and
in private, I desire your direction, I take my study already to
be furnisht after a grave and wise method.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> My Book-strings are sutable, and of a reaching
colour.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> How's this?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> My Standish of Wood, strange and sweet, and my
fore-flap hangs in the right place, and as near <i>Machiavel's</i>, as
can be gathered by tradition.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> Are there such men as will say nothing abroad, and
play the fools in their Lodgings? this Lord must be followed:
and hath your Lordship some new made words to scatter in
your speeches in publick, to gain note, that the hearers may
carry them away, and dispute of them at dinner?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I have Sir: and besides, my several Gowns and
Caps agreeable to my several occasions.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> 'Tis well, and you have learn'd to write a bad hand,
that the Readers may take pains for it.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Yes Sir, and I give out I have the palsie.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> Good, 'twere better though, if you had it: your
Lordship hath a Secretary, that can write fair, when you
purpose to be understood.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> 'Faith Sir I have one, there he stands, he hath been
my Secretary these seven years, but he hath forgotten to write.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> If he can make a writing face, it is not amiss, so he
keep his own counsel: your Lordship hath no hope of the
Gout?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Uh, little Sir, since the pain in my right foot left me.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> 'Twill be some scandal to your wisdom, though I
see your Lordship knows enough in publick business.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I am not imploy'd (though to my desert) in occasions
forreign, nor frequented for matters domestical.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> Not frequented? what course takes your Lordship?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> The readiest way, my door stands wi[de], my Secretary
knows I am not denied to any.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> In this (give me leave) your Lordship is out of the
way: make a back door to let out Intelligencers; seem to be
ever busie, and put your door under keepers, and you shall
have a troop of Clients sweating to come at you.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I have a back door already, I will henceforth be busie,
Secretary, run and keep the door.             <span class="directline">[<i>Exit Secretary.</i></span></p>

thought, and thought I had thought rightly; that malice
would long e'r this have hid her self in her Den, a[n]d have
turn'd her own sting against her own heart: but I well [now]
perceive, that so froward is the disposition of a deprav'd
nature, that it doth not only seek revenge, where it hath
receiv'd injury, but many times thirst after their destruction,
where it hath met with benefits.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Your Lordship may consider&mdash;</p>

no Traitor can answer it: but because you cannot answer this

I have beheld those dear conceal'd dishes, that have been

the Lord <i>Gondarino</i> to day, and would now again come to

<p><i>Gond.</i> Mercy, oh Duke, I do appeal to thee: plant
Canons there, and discharge them against my breast rather:
nay, first let this she-fury sit still where she does, and with
her nimble fingers stroke my hair, play with my fingers
ends, or any thing, until my panting heart have broke my
breast.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> You have liv'd the honester Captain; but be not so
dejected, but hold up thy head, and meat will sooner fall i'thy

<p><i>La-p.</i> I care not so much for meat, so I had but good
liquor, for which my guts croak like so many Frogs for rain.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> It seems, you are troubled with the wind-Collick,
Captain, swallow a bullet: 'tis present remedy I'll assure you.</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> A bullet? I'll tell you Sir, my panch is nothing but
a pile of bullets; when I was in any service I stood between
my Generall and the shot, like a mud-wall; I am all lead, from
the crown of the head to the soal of the foot, not a sound bone
about me.</p>

<p><i>La[v].</i> It seems you have bin in terrible hot service Captain.</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> It has ever bin the fate of the low Country wars to
spoil many a man, I ha' not bin the first nor shall not be the
last: but I'll tell you Sir, (hunger has brought it in to mind)
I served once at the Siege of <i>Braste</i>, 'tis memorable to this day,
where we were in great distress for victuals, whole troops fainted
more for want of food then for blood, and died, yet we were
resolved to stand it out; I my self was but then Gentleman of
a Company, and had as much need as any man, and indeed I
had perished had not a miraculous providence preserved me.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> As how good Captain?</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> Marry Sir, e'en as I was fainting and falling down
for want of sustenance, the enemy made a shot at me, and
struck me full ith' paunch with a penny loaf.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> Instead of a bullet!</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> In stead of a bullet.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> That was miraculous indeed; and that loaf sustained
you.</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> Nourished me or I had famished with the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> You have done worthy acts being a soldier, and now
you shall give me leave to requite your tale, and to acquaint
you with the most notorious deeds that I have done being a
Courtier. I protest Captain I will lie no more than you
have done.</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> I can indure no lies.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> I know you cannot Captain, therefore I'll only tell
you of strange things: I did once a deed of charity for it self;
I assisted a poor widow in a sute, and obtained it, yet I protest
I took not a penny for my labor.</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> 'Tis no such strange thing.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> By <i>Mars</i> Captain, but it is, and a very strange thing
too in a Courtier, it may take the upper hand of your penny
loaf for a miracle. I could ha' told you how many Ladyes
have languished for my love, and how I was once sollicited by
the mother, the daughter, and grand-mother; out of the least
of which I might have digg'd my self a fortune; they were all
great Ladyes, for two of them were so big I could hardly
embrace them: but I was sluggish in my rising courses, and
therefore let them pass; what means I had is spent upon such
as had the wit to cheat me; That wealth being gone, I have
only bought experience with it, with a strong hope to cheat
others; but see here comes the much declined <i>Montague</i>, who
had all the Manor houses, which were the body of his estate,
overthrowen by a great wind.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>La-p.</i> How by a great wind? was he not overthrown by law?</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> Yes, marry was he: but there was terrible puffing
and blowing before he was overthrown, if you observ'd, and
believe it Captain, there's no wind so dangerous to a building
as a lawyers breath.</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> What's he with him?</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> An eminent Citizen, Mounsier <i>Mallicorne</i>, let's
stand a side and listen their design.</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> Sir, profit is the Crown of labor, it is the life, the
soul of the industrious Merchant, in it he makes his paradise,
and for it neglects Wife, Children, Friends, Parents, nay all the
world, and delivers up himself to the violence of storms, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
be tos'd into unknown ayrs; as there is no faculty so perillous,
so there's none so worthy profitable.</p>

<p><i>Mont.</i> Sir, I am very well possest of it, and what of my
poore fortunes remaines, I would gladly hazard upon the Sea:
it cannot deal worse with me than the Land, though it sink or
throw it in the hands of Pirats. I have yet five hundred pounds
left, and your honest and worthy acquaintance may make me a
young Merchant; th'one moity of what I have I would gladly
adventure.</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> How adventure? you shall hazard nothing: you shall
only joyn with me in certain commodities that are safe arrived
unto the Key; you shall neither be in doubt of danger nor
dammage; But so much money disburst, so much receive; Sir,
I would have you conceive I pursue it not for any good your
money will do me, but meerly out of mine own freeness and
courtesie to pleasure you.</p>

<p><i>Mont.</i> I can believe no less, and you express a noble
nature, seeking to build up a man so ruin'd as my self.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> Captain here is subject for us to work upon if we
have wit; you hear that there is money yet left, and it is going
to be layd out in Rattels, Bels, Hobby-Horses, brown paper, or
some such like sale commodities; now it would do better in
our purses, upon our backs in good Gold-lace, and Scarlat, and
then we might pursue our projects, and our devices towards my
Lady <i>Annabella</i>; go to, there's a conceit newly landed, heark I
stand in good reputation with him, and therefore may the
better cheat him: Captain, take a few instructions from me.</p>

<p><i>Mont.</i> What monies I have is at your disposing, and upon
twelve I will meet you at the Pallace with it.</p>

<p><i>Mal.</i> I will there expect you, and so I take my leave.      <span class="directline">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> You apprehend me?</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> Why do ye think I am a dunce?</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> Not a dunce Captain, but you might give me leave
to misdoubt that pregnancy in a Soldier, which is proper and
hereditary to a Courtier; but prosecute it, I will both second,
and give credit to it. Good Mounsier <i>Montague</i>, I would your
whole revenues lay within the circuit of mine armes, that I
might as easily bestow, or restore it unto you as my curtesie.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> Believe it Sir, our affection towards you is a strong
band of friendship.</p>

<p><i>Mont.</i> To which I shall most willingly seal. But believe
me Gentlemen in a broken estate, the bond of friendship oft is
forfeited, but that it is your free and ingenuous nature to renew it.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> Sir, I will amply extend my self to your use, and am
very zealously afflicted as not one of your least friends for your
crooked fate; But let it not seise you with any dejection, you
have as I hear a sufficient competency left, which well disposed
may erect you as high in the worlds account as ever.</p>

<p><i>Mont.</i> I cannot live to hope it, much less injoy it, nor is it
any part of my endeavor; my study is to render every man his
own, and to contain my self within the limits of a Gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> I have the grant of an Office given me by some
noble favorites of mine in Court, there stands but a small matter
between me and it, if your ability be such to lay down the
present summ, out of the love I bear you, before any other man,
it shall be confirmed yours.</p>

<p><i>Mont.</i> I have heard you often speak of such a thing; If it
be assur'd to you I will gladly deal in it: that portion I have,
I would not hazard upon one course, for I see the most certain
is incertain.</p>

<p><i>La-p.</i> Having money Sir, you could not light upon men
that could give better direction; there is at this time a friend of
mine upon the Seas; to be plain with you, he is a pyrate, that
hath wrote to me to work his fredom, and by this Gentlemans
means, whose acquaintance is not small at Court; we have the
word of a worthy man for it, only there is some money to be
suddainly disburst, and if your happiness be such to make it up
you shall receive treble gain by it, and good assurance for it.</p>

<p><i>Mont.</i> Gentlemen, out of the weakness of my estate you
seem (to have some knowledge of my brest) that wou'd if it
were possible advance my declined fortunes, to satisfie all men
of whom I have had credit, and I know no way better than
these which you propose; I have some money ready under my
command, some part of it is already promis'd, but the remainder
is yours to such uses as are propounded.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> Appoint some certain place of meeting, for these
affaires require expedition.</p>

<p><i>Mount.</i> I will make it my present business: at twelve, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
am to meet <i>Mallicorne</i>, the Marchant at the Pallace, you know
him Sir, about some negotiation of the same nature, there I will
be ready to tender you that money, upon such conditions as we
shall conclude of.</p>

<p><i>Lav.</i> The care of it be yours, so much as the affair
concerns you.</p>

<p><i>Mont.</i> Your caution is effectuall, and till then I take my leave.</p>

but a groat about him, &amp; that was in two twopences too to
any man that wou'd make it up a shilling; that you were
kil'd with a Pistoll charg'd with white Powder; another offerd
to pawn his soul for five shillings, and yet no body wou'd take
him, that you were stab'd to death, and shou'd die with more
wounds than <i>Cæsar</i>.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> And who shou'd be the Butchers that shou'd do it?
<i>Montague</i> and his associates?</p>

you again, and be beholding to me, I know you not, I know
you not.</p>

<p><i>Rin.</i> Nay, but look ye, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Frig.</i> Pardon me: If you had been my bed-fellow these
seven years, and lent me money to buy my place, I must not
transgress principles: This very talking with you is an ill
example.</p>

<p><i>Rin.</i> Pish, you are too punctual a Courtier, Sir: why,
I am a Courtier too, yet never understood the place or name
to be so infectious to humanity and manners, as to cast a man
into a burning pride and arrogance, for which there is no cure.
I am a Courtier, and yet I will know my friends, I tell you.</p>

<p><i>Frig.</i> And I tell you, you will thrive accordingly, I
warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Rin.</i> But hark ye, Signior <i>Frigozo</i>, you shall first understand,
I have no friends with me to trouble you.</p>

<p><i>Frig.</i> Humh: That's a good motive.</p>

<p><i>Rin.</i> No[r] to borrow money of you.</p>

<p><i>Frig.</i> That's an excellent motive.</p>

<p><i>Rin.</i> No my sweet Don, nor to ask what you owe me.</p>

<p><i>Frig.</i> Why, that is the very motive of motives, why I
ought and will know thee: and if I had not wound thee up to
this promise, I would not have known thee these fifteen years,
no more than the errantst, or most founder'd <i>Castillian</i> that
followed our new Queens Carriages a-foot.</p>

<p><i>Rin.</i> Nor for any thing, dear Don, but that you would
place me conveniently to see the Play to night.</p>

<p><i>Frig.</i> That shall I, Signior <i>Rinaldo</i>: but would you had
come sooner: you see how full the Scaffolds are, there is scant
room for a Lovers thought here. Gentlewomen sit close for
shame: Has none of ye a little corner for this Gentleman? I'll
place ye, fear not. And how did our brave King of <i>Portugal</i>,
<i>Emanuel</i>, bear himself to day? You saw the solemnity of the
marriage.</p>

<p><i>Rin.</i> Why, like a fit Husband for so gracious and excellent
a Princess, as his worthy mate <i>Isabella</i>, the King of <i>Castiles</i>
Daughter doth in her very external li[ne]aments, mixture of
colours, and joyning Dove-like behaviour assure her self to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
And I protest (my dear Don) seriously, I can sing prophetically
nothing but blessed Hymns, and happy occasions to this sacred
union of <i>Portugal</i> and <i>Castile</i>, which have so wisely and mutually
conjoyned two such virtuous and beautiful Princes as these are;
and in all opinion like to multiply to their very last minute.</p>

<p><i>Frig.</i> The King is entring: Signior, hover here about,
and as soon as the Train is set, clap into me, we'll stand near
the State. If you have any Creditors here, they shall renew
bonds a Twelvemonth on such a sight: but to touch the pomel
of the King's Chair in the sight of a Citizen, is better security
for a thousand double Duckets, than three of the best Merchants
in <i>Lisbon</i>. Besides, Signior, we will censure, not only the
King in the Play here, that Reigns his two hours; but the
King himself, that is to rule his life time: Take my counsel:
I have one word to say to this noble Assembly, and I am for you.</p>

<p><i>Rin.</i> Your method shall govern me.</p></div>

<p><i>In the following references to the text the lines are numbered from the top of the
page, including titles, acts, stage directions, &amp;c., but not, of course, the

<p>It has not been thought necessary to record the correction of every turned
letter nor the substitution of marks of interrogation for marks of exclamation
and <i>vice versâ</i>. Full-stops have been silently inserted at the ends of speeches
and each fresh speaker has been given the dignity of a fresh line: in the
double-columned folio the speeches are frequently run on. Misprints in the
Quartos and the First Folio are recorded when they appear to be interesting.
A word or two from the printed text is attached to the variants recorded below
in cases where the variant, by itself, would not be sufficiently clear. Altered
punctuation is shown, usually, by printing the old punctuation.</p>

Prince, the Count <i>Palatine</i>, and the Lady <i>Elizabeth:</i> their highnesses at the
windowes of his privy gallerie upon the water, till their landing, which was at
the privy staires: where they were most honorablie received by the Lord
Chamberlaine, and so conducted to the Vestry.</p>

<p>The Hall was by that time filled with company of very good fashion, but
yet so as a very great number of principall Ladies, and other noble persons
were not yet come in, wherby it was foreseen that the roome would be so
scanted as might have been inconvenient. And there upon his Majesty was
most gratiously pleased with the consent of the gentlemen Maskers, to put off
the night until Saturday following with this special favour and priviledge,
that there should bee no let, as to the outward ceremony of magnificence
untill that time.</p>

<p>At the day that it was presented, there was a choice roome reserved for the
gentlemen, of both their houses, who comming in troope about seven of the
clocke, received that speciall honor and noble favour, as to be brought to
their places, by the Right Honourable the Earle of Northampton, Lord Privie
Seale.</p>

which these two societies have offered to his Majestie: Will not thinke much now

<p class="center">THE DEVISE OR | ARGUMENT OF THE | MASQUE.
</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap"><i>Jupiter</i></span> and <i>Juno</i> willing to doe honour to the Mariage of the two famous
Rivers <i>Thamesis</i> and <i>Rhene</i>, imploy their Messengers severally, <i>Mercurie</i>
and <i>Iris</i> for that purpose. They meete and contend: then <i>Mercurie</i> for his
part brings forth an Anti-masque all of Spirits or divine Natures: but yet not of
one kinde or liverie (because that had been so much in use heretofore) but as
it were in consort like to broken Musicke. And preserving the proprietie of
the devise; for that Rivers in nature are maintained either by Springs from
beneath, or Shewers from above: He raiseth foure of the <i>Naiades</i> out of the
Fountaines, and bringeth downe five of the <i>Hyades</i> out of the Cloudes to
daunce; hereupon <i>Iris</i> scoffes at <i>Mercurie</i> for that hee had devised a daunce
but of one Sexe, which could have no life: but <i>Mercurie</i> who was provided
for that exception, and in token that the Match should be blessed both with
Love and Riches calleth forth out of the Groves foure <i>Cupids</i>, and brings
downe from <i>Jupiters</i> Altar foure <i>Statuaes</i> of gold and silver to daunce with the
Nymphes and Starres: in which daunce the <i>Cupids</i> being blinde, and the
<i>Statuaes</i> having but halfe life put into them, and retaining still somewhat
of their old nature, giveth fit occasion to new and strange varieties both in
the Musick and paces. This was the first Anti-masque.</p>

<p>Then <i>Iris</i> for her part in scorne of this high flying devise, and in token
that the Match shall likewise be blessed with the love of the Common People,
calles to <i>Flora</i> her confederate (for that the Moneths of flowers are likewise
the Moneths of sweete shewers, and Raine-bowes) to bring in a May-daunce
or Rurall daunce, consisting likewise not of any suted persons, but of a
confusion, or commixture of all such persons as are naturall and proper for
Countrey sports. This is the second Anti-masque.</p>

<p>Then <i>Mercurie</i> and <i>Iris</i> after this vying one upon the other, seeme to leave
their contention: and <i>Mercurie</i> by the consent of <i>Iris</i> brings downe the
<i>Olympian</i> Knights, intimating that <i>Jupiter</i> having after a long discontinuance
revived the <i>Olympian</i> games, and summoned thereunto from all parts the
liveliest, &amp; activest persons that were, had enjoyned them before they fell to
their games to doe honour to these Nuptials. The <i>Olympian</i> games portend
to the Match, Celebritie, Victorie, and Felicitie. This was the maine Masque.</p>

<p>The Fabricke was a Mountaine with two descents, and severed with two
Travesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">The</span> first Travers was drawne, and the lower descent of the Mountaine
discovered; which was the Pendant of a hill to life, with divers boscages
and Grovets upon the steepe or hanging grounds thereof, and at the foote of
the Hill, foure delicate Fountaines running with water and bordered with
sedges and water flowers.</p>

<p><i>Iris</i> first appeared, and presently after <i>Mercurie</i> striving to overtake her.</p>

<p><i>Iris</i> apparelled in a robe of discoulored Taffita figured in variable colours,
like the Raine-bowe, a cloudie wreath on her head, and Tresses.</p>

<p><i>Mercurie</i> in doublet and hose of white Taffita, a white hat, wings on his
shoulders and feet, his Caduceus in his hand, speaking to <i>Iris</i> as followeth.</p>
